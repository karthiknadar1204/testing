# End-to-End Guide: Hosting a Website on Ubuntu with Nginx, Certbot SSL, and Jenkins

Below is a compiled sequence of commands and brief explanations showing how to:

1. **SSH into your Ubuntu server using a private key**  
2. **Install and configure Nginx**  
3. **Install Java/OpenJDK**  
4. **Install and configure Jenkins**  
5. **Secure your domain with Let's Encrypt (Certbot)**  

> **Note:** Replace paths, usernames, IP addresses, and domain names with your own as needed.

---

## 1. SSH into the Server

### Make the private key secure

```bash
chmod 600 /Users/karthiknadar/Downloads/website-responsive-key.pem
```

Ensures only the owner (chmod 600) can read the key file. This is required by SSH to use the key securely.

### SSH with the private key

```bash
ssh -i /Users/karthiknadar/Downloads/website-responsive-key.pem ubuntu@<instance-public_ip>
```

## 2. Update and Switch to root

Once you are logged in, update your package list and switch to the root user if preferred.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo su
```

- `sudo apt update` refreshes the list of available packages.
- `sudo su` switches to root. (Alternatively, you can continue using sudo before each command.)

## 3. Install and Configure Nginx

### Install Nginx

```bash
apt install nginx
```

### Check Nginx Status

```bash
systemctl status nginx
```

Verifies that Nginx is active (running). If it's not running, you can start it:

```bash
systemctl start nginx
```

### Directory Structure

```bash
cd /var/www/
ls
```

**By default, Nginx serves content from `/var/www/html/`.**

## 4. Install Java / OpenJDK

If you need Java on your server—for example, to run Jenkins—install OpenJDK:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
java -version
```

Installs OpenJDK 17 and checks the installed version.

## 5. Install Jenkins

### Add Jenkins Repository and Key

```bash
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | sudo tee \
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
```

### Install and Start Jenkins

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```

Installs Jenkins on your Ubuntu server, starts it, and verifies it is running.

### Retrieve Initial Admin Password

```bash
cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

Copy this password and paste it into the Jenkins UI when you first access Jenkins at `http://<your_server_ip_or_domain>:8080`.

## 6. Adjust Permissions for Nginx Web Root (Optional)

If you want Jenkins or another user to manage the website files in `/var/www/html/`:

```bash
sudo chown -R jenkins:jenkins /var/www/html
```

Gives ownership of `/var/www/html` to the jenkins user and group.

## 7. Install Certbot for HTTPS (Let's Encrypt)

To secure your domain with HTTPS, you'll use Certbot (from Let's Encrypt). Make sure your DNS (A record) points to the IP of your server.

### Install Certbot with Nginx Plugin

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Installs Certbot and the Nginx plugin, which helps with automatic certificate generation and renewal.

### Obtain an SSL Certificate

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-domain>
```

- `-d <your-domain>`: Replace `<your-domain>` with your own domain.
- Follow on-screen instructions to enter your email, agree to terms, and allow Certbot to configure HTTPS.
- **Important**: Your domain's DNS must resolve to this server before this works.

If the first attempt fails, ensure your DNS is correctly pointing to the server. Then, try again:

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d <your-domain>
```
